Several Observations

1. That Capomulin had the greatest number of time points in the study speaks highly of the longevity of the lifespan of the mice under this treatment.    
2. The drug which most closely matched Capomulin in most categories was Ramicane, which performed slightly better in most instances (when looking at Tumor Volume.)  No other drug was similar in effectiveness, in fact all the other regimens seem to be in a pretty big clump behind.
3. There is a very high correlation between overall mouse weight and tumor volume.  It seems pretty obvious from the start but the data conforms it.
